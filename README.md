# learningX :fire:
This repository is a way to share awesome resources which I found very useful while I am learning new technology and this repository acts as a bookmark where I can store all important links which I need to revisit.

The official documentation is always the best and most StackOverflow answers route back to them. But, sometimes we want to get an overall picture and then deep dive.

## Disclaimer
Whatever resources I’m sharing is based on my view. For example if it’s a youtube video then mostly I have watched a couple of videos related and found the very video easy and clean to understand.
