This repository is a way to share awesome resources which I found very useful while I am learning new technology and this repository acts as a bookmark where I can store all important links which I need to revisit.

## Disclaimer
Whatever resources I’m sharing is based on my view. For example if it’s a youtube video then mostly I have watched a couple of videos related and found the very video easy and clean to understand.

## Topics

 - [AWS](#aws)
 - [Prometheus](#prometheus)

## AWS

 - [AWS - VPC Demo, Public & Private Subnets, Route Tables, Internet & NAT Gateways]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD9vDv0uyI8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD9vDv0uyI8))
